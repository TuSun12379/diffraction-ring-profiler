**A program for extracting electron diffraction ring pattern profiles, comparing simulation and making figures.**

Produced by [Dr. David Mitlin's Research Group](http://www.mitlingroup.com/) from the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering at the Univerity of Alberta

If you found this program helpful in your research, please cite it by using a line similar to:

"TEM diffraction patterns were analysed with Diffraction Ring Profiler, which was developed for phase identification in complex microstructures`[cite]`"

**(Fixed in version 1.7)** -**Bug**-: If the program launches with an error after you upgrade to the latest version (usually seen on Windows 7), you must clear the matplotlib cache by deleting the ".matplotlib" directory in your home directory.
